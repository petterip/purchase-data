<h3>Master's Thesis for INTERACT research group</h3>
<p>Purchase Data Analytics is a proof of concept application for demonstrating the reverse use of customer data. The application allow informants to import purchase data made available to customers by S Group, and grocery shopping receipts. The receipts complete otherwise sparse purchase data with nutritional details. Lastly, the data is visualized for the informant to evaluate its usefulness and meaningfulness.</p>
<p>By default the GitLab repository does not contain file 'all_prods.json' which is necessary to for recognizing receipts. Please <a herf="mailto:petteri.ponsimaa@oulu.fi">contact the author</a> for instructions how to get it.</p>

					<p><strong>In the past decades, digital health has grown into one of most active and vibrant topics in information and computer sciences. We are able to leverage technology on novel data to improve our well-being and also promote healthier life-style of the people around us (MacLean, 2014).</strong></p>
					<p>Our shopping habits and consumption patterns are already tracked and available for the main grocery shopping chains in Finland. The data is primarily used for personalized marketing and advertising based on the analysis of customer data. However, if the data were directly available to consumers, already ubiquitous computing provides the means for people to reflect on their consumption behaviours and empower them to improve their diet. In Finland, obesity has steadily increased during the last decades. Recent studies show that fruits and vegetables, particularly berries, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in men. Thus, there is clear potential for digital health applications with a focus on changing peopleâ€™s attitudes towards healthier consumption behaviours, and eventually improving quality of life.</p>
					<p>Through design science research, the thesis makes use of grocery purchase data available to S Group customers and receipt data provided by the customers. The goal is to construct a research application supporting behaviour change on it users through design, awareness-building, reflection, and motivation through collaboration. To evaluate the design, 8-10 customers are invited to be part of the study group to provide purchase data and feedback on the application. The focus is on building visual designs of the grocery consumption patterns based on customer interviews and then evaluating the impact on the study group via online questionnaires and usage data.</p>
					<p>This thesis aims at supporting the Digital Health Revolution program, which is a multidisciplinary research project. The program focuses on enabling utilization of data about individuals as part of personal and preventive services and has potential to increase one's wellbeing by self-management. When an individual has the ability to use personal health data to affect his or her personal decisions it may promote healthier life-style. The data can be processed for the benefit of both the individual and the society by creating digital service solutions. The program was launched August 14th, 2014. </p>
